      <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
      <div class="artist-statement">
        <p>My work explores the relationship between fashion and spatial distortion through exaggerated contortion and bold, contrasting color. Each figure is stylized, its elongated limbs and angular poses designed to explore negative space and challenge conventional ideas of proportion. The body is a compositional tool that defines and divides the canvas. Color is a significant decision in what I create because of the simplistic style. The colors need to be interesting enough to warrant my flat style and negative space in my works.
</p>
        <p> They activate the surface and heighten the sense of tension within the pose. Themed fashion elements, such as patterns and accessories, ground the figures in contemporary culture. This transforms them into stylized symbols of self-expression and identity. These figures demonstrate the significance of fashion as an advertisement of self. Through this combination of color and form, my paintings reimagine the human figure as both object and ornament.</code></p>
